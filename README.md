Takacoin Software Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch of the Takacoin repository is regularly built and tested, but it may not always be completely stable. New features and improvements are developed in feature branches and undergo testing before being merged into the `master` branch.

Tags are created periodically from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Takacoin. These releases provide users with reliable and well-tested versions of the software.

The https://github.com/takacoin/gui repository is dedicated to the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) for Takacoin. The `master` branch of this repository is synchronized with the `master` branches of other repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist for the GUI repository, so forking it should only be done for development purposes.

If you're interested in contributing to Takacoin, please follow the guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For valuable insights and tips for developers, refer to [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

### Automated Testing in Takacoin

Automated testing is a fundamental part of the Takacoin development process, ensuring the stability, reliability, and security of the codebase. Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for both new and existing code to maintain high-quality standards.

Unit tests, which can be found in [src/test/README.md](src/test/README.md), validate individual components of the code. You can compile and run unit tests (assuming they are enabled in the configuration) using the command: `make check`. For in-depth information on running and expanding unit tests, refer to [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

Takacoin also employs regression and integration tests written in Python. These tests, located in [/test](/test), provide comprehensive coverage. You can execute these tests using the test runner script (assuming you have the necessary [test dependencies](/test) installed): `test/functional/test_runner.py`.

Our Continuous Integration (CI) systems ensure that every pull request undergoes automatic builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Unit and sanity tests are also run automatically during this process.

By contributing to and maintaining our robust testing framework, you help uphold the quality and security of Takacoin. For updates on testing efforts and developments, visit our official website: https://www.takacoin.com.



### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing in Takacoin

Manual Quality Assurance (QA) testing is an integral part of ensuring the reliability and correctness of code changes in Takacoin. It is essential that changes are tested by individuals other than the developers who authored the code. This practice becomes particularly crucial for extensive or high-risk modifications.

For substantial changes, we strongly recommend adding a comprehensive test plan to the description of your pull request. A detailed test plan helps outline the testing process and ensures that the changes are rigorously evaluated.

Manual QA testing allows us to identify potential issues and inconsistencies that may not be apparent through automated testing alone. It helps prevent defects from entering the codebase, enhancing the overall quality of Takacoin.

Collaborative efforts in QA testing contribute to the robustness of our project. By adhering to this practice, we ensure that code changes are thoroughly examined and that the software remains stable and dependable.
